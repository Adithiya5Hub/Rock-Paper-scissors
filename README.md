# Rock-Paper-scissors
Hello Everyone!!
I made this project by using HTML-CSS & JS.
You'll be playing against the computer.
You get to pick either rock or paper or scissors and the computer picks and the result 
will be displayed based on whether did you win or loose or is it a tie

I've added comments to the code written in JavaScript so that you can understand how each function is working
